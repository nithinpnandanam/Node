## HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) are two different protocols (sets of rules) used for transferring data between a server and a client over a network, typically the Internet.

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
**Purpose**: HTTP is primarily used for transferring hypertext documents (like HTML), which are used to display web pages. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
**How It Works**: When you enter a URL in your web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server. The server then responds with the requested resource (e.g., an HTML page, image, etc.), which the browser then displays.
**Rules**: HTTP defines rules for how requests (from the client) and responses (from the server) are structured, how headers and content are formatted, and how connections are managed.

### FTP (File Transfer Protocol):
**Purpose**: FTP is specifically designed for transferring files between a client and a server. It is commonly used for uploading and downloading files to and from a server.
**How It Works**: With FTP, a client connects to an FTP server and can then perform actions like uploading, downloading, renaming, or deleting files on the server. FTP can operate in two modes: active and passive, which affect how data connections are established.
**Rules**: FTP defines rules for initiating connections, authenticating users, navigating directories, and transferring files. It also specifies different modes of data transfer, like binary and ASCII.

## Summary
* Both HTTP and FTP are protocols, which means they establish a standardized set of rules for communication between a client and a server. These rules dictate how data is requested, sent, and received across a network.
* HTTP is used mainly for delivering web pages and web content.
* FTP is used for transferring files between systems.
