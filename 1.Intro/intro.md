Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more.
Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O.
asynchronous I/O means non blocking I/O
