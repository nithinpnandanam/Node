Js follows ECMA Script
ECMAScript is a standard for scripting languages
JS Engines follows these standards.
V8 is a JavaScript engine that implements the ECMAScript standard.
This means that V8 is designed to understand and execute JavaScript code that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
When the ECMAScript standard is updated with new features (e.g., ES6 introduced classes, arrow functions, promises, etc.), V8 is updated to support these new features. 
The goal is to ensure that any JavaScript code written according to the ECMAScript standard will run correctly on V8.
********************************************************************************************************************************************
V8 can be embedded into any C++ application.
Node.js is a c++ application so V8 can be embedded into it
