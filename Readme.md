* Database is an organised collection of data

* Redis is like a cache
* small amount of data can be stored
* frequently fetched data is kept there
* when the user is searching for something first looks into cache then if not present it looks into actual database
* thus if we use redis faster response is obtained

* RDBMS uses relationships between different tables
* Nosql [in MongoDB]=> rows==***document*** and table == ***collection*** and columns==***field***
* each key in a document is called ***field***
* for maintianing hobies we dont need a seperate table
* we can have an array of all the hobies in the document itself
